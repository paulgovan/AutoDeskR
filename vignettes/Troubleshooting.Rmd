## Common Issues
Here is a running list of common issues that users have run into:


Problem: Some of the functions seem to work, others don't.

Solution: Make sure to sign up for the correct APIs and services through AutoDesk Forge.


Problem: I can't create bucket "mybucket".

Solution: Try a unique bucket name.


Problem: I was able to create a bucket and upload a file, but I can't translate the file.

Solution: Each task requires different tokens with different scopes. Make sure to create a token with the "data:read data:write" scopes in order to translate a file.
